# Zero-shot assessments
Following review [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09087), we carry out zero-shot homology classification (task2 for Rfam, task3 for ArchiveII) and zero-shot secondary structure prediction (task1). The origin data and feature embeddings of other models can be obtained at [https://zenodo.org/records/14430869](https://zenodo.org/records/14430869).
